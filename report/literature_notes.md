## Birchfield 2003

**Generative model for the creation of musical emotion, meaning, and form**

Describes a generative method to create scores, based on genetic algorithm for frequency, harmony, metre and rhythm.

**Generative Soundscapes for Experiential Communication**

_Good intro to soundscapes._

Real time soundscape generation, adaptive to context (provided explicitly). Communicate participants experiences in social networks based on manually uploaded and annotated media.

## Eigenfeldt & Pasquier 2011

**Negotiated content: generative soundscape composition by autonomous musical agents in coming together: freesound**

_Another good intro to generative music / soundscapes._

Agents generate phrases by semi-randomly selecting from freesound.org. Each agent uses metadata tags and spectral info to choose appropriate samples (that won't clash with other agents). Listening experiment compares the performance of the generative system to human composed soundscape.

## Thorogood & Pasquier 2013

**Computationally Created Soundscapes with Audio Metaphor**

_Present together with Eigenfeldt & Pasquier 2011._

Natural language query goes to twitter and back for analysis to get tags. Fetch samples from freesound.org and compose them automatically.
