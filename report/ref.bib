abstract = {This paper suggests a direction in the development of Surveillance Studies that goes beyond current attention for the caring, productive and enabling aspects of surveillance practices. That is, surveillance could be considered not just as positively protective, but even as a comical, playful, amusing, enjoyable practice. A number of recent trends suggest that there is a potential for unmistakable entertainment in the operation of a number of contemporary surveillance practices that merit further empirical and theoretical study. The paper discusses several examples that are illustrative of these trends, such as computer games and artistic presentations. Although this analysis does not downplay the problematic and negative features of current surveillance practices, it aims to accentuate some of the ways in which surveillance-enabling technologies are able to perform entertainment functions.},

abstract = {The automated creation of perceptible and compelling large- scale forms and hierarchical structures that unfold over time is a nontrivial challenge for generative models of multimedia content. Nonetheless, this is an important goal for multimedia authors and artists who work in time-dependent mediums. This paper and associated demonstration materials present a generative model for the automated composition of music. The model draws on theories of emotion and meaning in music, and relies on research in cognition and perception to ensure that the generated music will be communicative and intelligible to listeners. The model employs a coevolutionary genetic algorithm that is comprised of a population of musical components. The evolutionary compositions which are realized as digital audio, a live performance work, and a musical process yields musical score in conventional notation. These works exhibit musical features which are in accordance with aesthetic and compositional goals described in the paper.},

@article{Brighenti2010,
abstract = {Introduction: Into the field of surveillance art In this article I review a series of artworks, artistic performances and installations that deal with the topic of surveillance. 1 My aim is twofold. On the one hand, I want to look comparatively at how different artists interrogate, question, quote, or criticise the surveillance society. On the other hand, I take these artistic actions as themselves symptomatic of the ways in which surveillance interrogates contemporary society. In other words, my claim is that surveillance does not simply produce substantive social control and social triage, it also contributes to the formation of an ideoscape and a collective imagery about what security, insecurity, and control are ultimately about, as well as the landscape of moods and affects a surveillance society like ours expresses. Broadly speaking, we could call 'artveillance' the domain of the reciprocal influences and exchanges between art and surveillance. The recognition of such domain of enquiry has two major implications: on the one hand, more obviously, it invites us to consider art as 'technological', in the sense that art is always tied to a technology of production and a technology of mediation (and re-mediation). From this point of view, new visual and digital technologies cannot fail to have profound impact on contemporary art (see, among others, Paul 2003; Wands 2006; Barilli 2007). On the other hand, perhaps less intuitively, artveillance also suggests that we regard surveillance not as a merely technical process focused exclusively on recording images, tracking data flows and processing acquired and stored data, but also as a somewhat 'artful' set of techniques, which may be more creative and, with L{\'{e}}vi-Strauss, more similar to bricolage than usually assumed in surveillance studies. In this paper I am going to deal only with one side, or one flow, of artveillance, that is surveillance art.},

The design methodology incorporates the use of concatenative synthesis to construct a sound environment using online community-provided sonic material, and an application of this methodology is described in which sound environments are generated for Google Street View using the online sound database Freesound. Furthermore, the model allows for the creation of augmented soundscapes using parameterization models as an input to the resynthesis paradigm, which incorporates multiple source and textural layers. A subjective evaluation of this application was performed to compare the immersive properties of the generated soundscapes with those of real recordings, and the results suggest a general preference to the generated oundscapes incorporating sound design principles. The potential for further research and future applications in the area of augmented reality are discussed incorporating emerging web media technologies.},

Thus far the algorithmic basis of this process is unknown and there exists no artificial system with similar capabilities. How- ever, in other key areas of visual perception such as object and face recognition near-human performance was recently demonstrated by a class of biologically inspired vision models called Deep Neural Networks.1,2 Here we introduce an artificial system based on a Deep Neural Network that creates artistic images of high perceptual quality. The system uses neural representations to sepa- rate and recombine content and style of arbitrary images, providing a neural algorithm for the creation of artistic images. Moreover, in light of the strik- ing similarities between performance-optimised artificial neural networks and biological vision,3–7 our work offers a path forward to an algorithmic under- standing of how humans create and perceive artistic imagery.},

After passing through airport security, the player must find and recover their drugs from the innocent bystanders, without them ever realizing they were involved in the game. The game explores the nature of pervasive game playing in environments that are not, generally, regarded as playful or “fun”. This paper describes the game's design and implementation as well as an evaluation conducted with participants in real airports. It explores the players' reactions to the game through questionnaire responses and in-game activity. The technologies used in Blowtooth are, intentionally, simple in order for the enjoyment of the game to be reliant more on the physical environment rather than the enabling technologies. We conclude that situating pervasive games in unexpected and challenging environments, such as international airports, may provide interesting and unique gaming experiences for players. In addition, we argue that pervasive games benefit most from using the specific features and nature of interesting real-world environments rather than focusing on the enabling technologies.},

@article{Milanovic2015,
abstract = {The 2013 revelations by Edward Snowden of the scope and magnitude of electronic surveillance programs run by the US National Security Agency (NSA) and some of its partners, chief among them the UK Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), have provoked intense and ongoing public debate regarding the proper limits of such intelligence activities. Privacy activists decry such programs, especially those involving the mass collection of the data or communications of ordinary individuals across the globe, arguing that they create an inhibiting surveillance climate that diminishes basic freedoms, while government officials justify them as being necessary for the prevention of terrorism. The purpose of this article, however, is not to assess the general propriety or usefulness of surveillance programs or their compliance with relevant domestic law. I do not want to argue that electronic surveillance programs, whether targeted or done on mass scale, are per se illegal, ineffective or unjustifiable. Rather, want I want to look at is how the legality of such programs would be debated and assessed within the framework of international human rights law, and specifically under the major human rights treaties to which the ‘Five Eyes' and other states with sophisticated technological capabilities are parties.In the wake of the UN General Assembly's 2013 resolution on the right to privacy in the digital age, it can be expected that electronic surveillance and related activities will remain on the agenda of UN bodies for years to come, especially since the political relevance of the topic shows no signs of abating. Similarly, cases challenging surveillance on human rights grounds are already pending before domestic and international courts.The discussion has just started, and it will continue at least partly in human rights terms, focusing on the rights and interests of the affected individuals, rather than solely on the interests and sovereignty of states. The primary purpose of this article is to advance this conversation by looking at one specific, threshold issue: whether human rights treaties such as the ICCPR and the ECHR even apply to foreign surveillance. The article will show that while there is much uncertainty in how the existing case law on the jurisdictional threshold issues might apply to foreign surveillance, this uncertainty should not be overestimated – even if it can and is being exploited. The only truly coherent approach to the threshold question of applicability, I will argue, is that human rights treaties should apply to virtually all foreign surveillance activities. That the treaties apply to such activities, however, does not mean that they are necessarily unlawful. Rather, the lawfulness of a given foreign surveillance program is subject to a fact-specific examination on the merits of its compliance with the right to privacy, and in that, I submit, foreign surveillance activities are no different from purely domestic ones.},

The model is sampled using our recent result in efficient sampling of the Regular constraint.

abstract = {The soundscape composition, as pioneered at Simon Fraser University since the early 1970s, has evolved rapidly to explore a full range of approaches from the 'found sound' representation of acoustic environments through to the incorporation of highly abstracted sonic transformations. The structural approaches similarly range from being analogues of real-world experience, such as listening from a fixed spatial perspective or moving through a connected series of acoustic spaces, to those that mirror both nonlinear mental experiences of memory recall, dreams, and free association, as well as artificial sonic constructs made familiar and possible by modern 'schizophonic' audio techniques of sonic layering and embedding. The octophonic surround-sound playback format as used in contemporary soundscape presentations has achieved a remarkable sense of immersion in a recreated or imaginary sonic environment. Specific works realised at SFU are analysed that illustrate each of these approaches. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

When applied to text-to-speech, it yields state-of-the-art performance, with human listeners rating it as significantly more natural sounding than the best parametric and concatenative systems for both English and Mandarin. A single WaveNet can capture the characteristics of many different speakers with equal fidelity, and can switch between them by conditioning on the speaker identity. When trained to model music, we find that it generates novel and often highly realistic musical fragments. We also show that it can be employed as a discriminative model, returning promising results for phoneme recognition.},
