abstract = {The automated creation of perceptible and compelling large- scale forms and hierarchical structures that unfold over time is a nontrivial challenge for generative models of multimedia content. Nonetheless, this is an important goal for multimedia authors and artists who work in time-dependent mediums. This paper and associated demonstration materials present a generative model for the automated composition of music. The model draws on theories of emotion and meaning in music, and relies on research in cognition and perception to ensure that the generated music will be communicative and intelligible to listeners. The model employs a coevolutionary genetic algorithm that is comprised of a population of musical components. The evolutionary compositions which are realized as digital audio, a live performance work, and a musical process yields musical score in conventional notation. These works exhibit musical features which are in accordance with aesthetic and compositional goals described in the paper.},

abstract = {Web 2.0 and Social media have widened society's opportunities for communication amusement and networking, while enabling internet users to contribute online content. The information flows created, along with Open Source Intelligence techniques, can be crawled and processed for a variety of reasons from personalized advertising to behaviour prediction/profiling. In this paper, our goal is to present two horror stories from the digital world of Social Media, in order to: (a). Present an insider threat prediction method by (e)valuat-ing a users' personality trait of narcissism, which is deemed to be closely con-nected to the manifestation of malevolent insiders, as it was developed via Twitter. (b). Raise user awareness over political profiling and data processing for discriminative purposes, via a methodology applied to YouTube. As both methodologies set user's privacy and dignity at stake, we provide the reader with an analysis of the legal means for each case, so as to effectively be prevented from a privacy violation threat and also present the exceptional cases, such as the selection of security officers of critical infrastructures, where methodologies to detect the insider threat could be used.},

@article{Milanovic2015,
abstract = {The 2013 revelations by Edward Snowden of the scope and magnitude of electronic surveillance programs run by the US National Security Agency (NSA) and some of its partners, chief among them the UK Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), have provoked intense and ongoing public debate regarding the proper limits of such intelligence activities. Privacy activists decry such programs, especially those involving the mass collection of the data or communications of ordinary individuals across the globe, arguing that they create an inhibiting surveillance climate that diminishes basic freedoms, while government officials justify them as being necessary for the prevention of terrorism. The purpose of this article, however, is not to assess the general propriety or usefulness of surveillance programs or their compliance with relevant domestic law. I do not want to argue that electronic surveillance programs, whether targeted or done on mass scale, are per se illegal, ineffective or unjustifiable. Rather, want I want to look at is how the legality of such programs would be debated and assessed within the framework of international human rights law, and specifically under the major human rights treaties to which the ‘Five Eyes' and other states with sophisticated technological capabilities are parties.In the wake of the UN General Assembly's 2013 resolution on the right to privacy in the digital age, it can be expected that electronic surveillance and related activities will remain on the agenda of UN bodies for years to come, especially since the political relevance of the topic shows no signs of abating. Similarly, cases challenging surveillance on human rights grounds are already pending before domestic and international courts.The discussion has just started, and it will continue at least partly in human rights terms, focusing on the rights and interests of the affected individuals, rather than solely on the interests and sovereignty of states. The primary purpose of this article is to advance this conversation by looking at one specific, threshold issue: whether human rights treaties such as the ICCPR and the ECHR even apply to foreign surveillance. The article will show that while there is much uncertainty in how the existing case law on the jurisdictional threshold issues might apply to foreign surveillance, this uncertainty should not be overestimated – even if it can and is being exploited. The only truly coherent approach to the threshold question of applicability, I will argue, is that human rights treaties should apply to virtually all foreign surveillance activities. That the treaties apply to such activities, however, does not mean that they are necessarily unlawful. Rather, the lawfulness of a given foreign surveillance program is subject to a fact-specific examination on the merits of its compliance with the right to privacy, and in that, I submit, foreign surveillance activities are no different from purely domestic ones.},

abstract = {We present FlowComposer, a web application that helps users compose musical lead sheets, i.e. melodies with chord labels. Flow-Composer integrates a constrained-based lead sheet generation tool in which the user retains full control over the generation process. Users specify the style of the lead sheet by selecting a corpus of existing lead sheets. The system then produces a complete lead sheet in that style, either from scratch, or from a partial lead sheet entered by the user. The generation algorithm is based on a graphical model that combines two Markov chains enriched by Regular constraints, representing the melody and its related chord sequence. The model is sampled using our recent result in efficient sampling of the Regular constraint. The paper reports on the design and deployment of FlowComposer as a web-service, part of an ecosystem of online tools for the creation of lead sheets. FlowCom-poser is currently used in professional musical productions, from which we collect and show a number of representative examples.},

abstract = {This paper introduces WaveNet, a deep neural network for generating raw audio waveforms. The model is fully probabilistic and autoregressive, with the predic-tive distribution for each audio sample conditioned on all previous ones; nonethe-less we show that it can be efficiently trained on data with tens of thousands of samples per second of audio. When applied to text-to-speech, it yields state-of-the-art performance, with human listeners rating it as significantly more natural sounding than the best parametric and concatenative systems for both English and Mandarin. A single WaveNet can capture the characteristics of many different speakers with equal fidelity, and can switch between them by conditioning on the speaker identity. When trained to model music, we find that it generates novel and often highly realistic musical fragments. We also show that it can be employed as a discriminative model, returning promising results for phoneme recognition.},

abstract = {The soundscape composition, as pioneered at Simon Fraser University since the early 1970s, has evolved rapidly to explore a full range of approaches from the 'found sound' representation of acoustic environments through to the incorporation of highly abstracted sonic transformations. The structural approaches similarly range from being analogues of real-world experience, such as listening from a fixed spatial perspective or moving through a connected series of acoustic spaces, to those that mirror both nonlinear mental experiences of memory recall, dreams, and free association, as well as artificial sonic constructs made familiar and possible by modern 'schizophonic' audio techniques of sonic layering and embedding. The octophonic surround-sound playback format as used in contemporary soundscape presentations has achieved a remarkable sense of immersion in a recreated or imaginary sonic environment. Specific works realised at SFU are analysed that illustrate each of these approaches. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},
